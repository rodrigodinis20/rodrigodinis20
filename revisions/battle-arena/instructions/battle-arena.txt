Battle Arena

Let's create a battle simulation game!

Our game will have Fighters. Each fighter can hit or cast a spell on another fighter (cause damage). The amount of damage caused will depend on how much attack damage (for hits) or spell damage (for casts) the attacking fighter has.

There are 3 specific types of fighters (Mages, Trolls and Gladiators), which attack and suffer damage in a different way:
- When a mage casts a spell, he has a chance to create a shield for himself - which means the next time he gets attacked no damaged will be done.
- When a gladiator hits there is a chance that double the damage is caused (critical).
- Some of the time a troll is ordered to attack, it might not do anything (trolls, right??)

Our game is going to be played by two players. Each player will have an array with his fighters (a mix of the three types).
Players will take turns attacking each other. For a player to attack he should first choose a random alive Fighter from his array, and select a random alive Fighter from the opponent's array. After both Fighters have been chosen, the attacking fighter will randomly hit or cast a spell on the opponent's fighter.
The game finishes when all of the fighters of one player have been killed.
